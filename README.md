Instructive is a Education Management System focused on revitalizing the adminisrative side of IEP management. 
An Individual Education Plan, better known as an IEP, is a student-specific plan to help foster a better learning environment without compromising quality. It is a dynamic outline that allows students to meet with teachers, and counsellors to plan for their success in a way that best suits them.
An IEP for a student with a common learning disability would include educational goals, achievements, various learning preferences among categories, and accommodations. 

Keeping the quality of education at the highest throughout the classroom is a difficult task for teachers as many students possess different needs. Trying to meet these needs is more than just giving the student more time, it can be altering assignments to fit their learning style, or allowing them to work in a quieter environment. With growing classrooms, this can become hard to manage, very fast. 

Instructive solves this by centralizing IEPs, Curriculums, Core Competencies, and Teacher Reports. Within a centralized system, less time is required to create student profiles, new IEPs, and ensure learning targets are met. 

Using an narrowly trained LLM, we allow teachers to effectively create Assessment plans for specific classes, suggesting adaptation plans, and ensuring learning targets are met just as well for everyone. 
Instructive additionally permits for teachers to create their own units, add learning targets, and immediately know whether they are meeting the government's requirements.
