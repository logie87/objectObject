# BC IEP ADAPTATION MENU (GENERAL, NON-ASSIGNMENT SPECIFIC)
Professional Reference – Aligned with BC Curriculum & Inclusive Education Policy

This menu is designed for use across courses and grade levels in British Columbia.  
It is grounded in:
- **BC’s Inclusive Education policy and guidelines**, which emphasize equitable access and full participation for students with disabilities and diverse abilities.  
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** and flexible assessment principles in the BC Curriculum (multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression).  
- The distinction between **adaptations** (same learning standards, different supports/strategies) and **modifications** (different learning standards), as outlined in BC Ministry documents.

Use this as a **pick-and-apply toolkit**: choose the supports that match the student’s IEP, and apply consistently across subjects.

## 1. FOUNDATIONS (BC CONTEXT)

### 1.1 Key Principles

- All students are entitled to **equitable access, participation, and achievement** in the BC curriculum.  
- **Adaptations**:
  - Are changes to instruction, environment, or assessment.
  - Do **not** change the expected Learning Standards.
- **Modifications**:
  - Change the expected outcomes (student works on goals substantially different from BC grade-level standards).
  - Must be clearly documented in the IEP.

These principles reflect current provincial guidance on inclusive education, adaptations, and reporting.  

### 1.2 Practice Priorities

For most students with IEPs working toward **grade-level standards**, your default move is:
1. Keep the same **Big Ideas** and Curricular Competencies.
2. Adjust:
   - how information is given,
   - how students work with it,
   - how they show what they know.

---

## 2. ADAPTATIONS BY MODE OF LEARNING & EXPRESSION

The following sections are organized by **how** students access and demonstrate learning, not by specific assignments.

### 2.1 Reading & Viewing

**Goals:** support comprehension of oral, written, visual, and digital texts without reducing core expectations unless specified in IEP.

Adaptation options:
- Provide **audio versions / read-aloud** (adult, peer, or tech).
- Use **chunked text**: shorter sections, headings, bolded key ideas.
- Offer **summaries or previews** of complex readings.
- Use **visual supports**:
  - diagrams, timelines, graphic organizers,
  - images anchored to key concepts.
- Allow **shared reading**:
  - partner reading,
  - echo or choral reading,
  - teacher modeling of think-aloud strategies.
- Pre-teach:
  - vocabulary,
  - background knowledge (especially for abstract or culturally distant topics).

When to document as **adaptation**:
- Student is engaging with the same essential content/standards using supported formats.

---

### 2.2 Writing & Representing

**Goals:** allow students to communicate ideas, analysis, and reflection in accessible ways.

Adaptation options:
- Reduce length requirements:
  - fewer sentences/paragraphs with clearer expectations.
- Break tasks into **steps**:
  - idea generation → organizer → draft → edit (each with simple checklist).
- Offer **sentence starters / frames**:
  - “The main idea is…”
  - “One example is…”
  - “This shows that…”
- Permit **alternate formats**:
  - point-form responses,
  - labeled diagrams,
  - graphic novels / visual storytelling,
  - slide decks with speaker notes.
- Support with **technology**:
  - speech-to-text,
  - predictive text,
  - spelling/grammar tools (where appropriate).
- Allow **scribing** by adult/peer when written output is a barrier.
- Provide explicit teaching on:
  - breaking long sentences into clear ones,
  - using transition words,
  - organizing paragraphs.

Assessment focus:
- Prioritize clarity of thinking and connection to outcomes over handwriting, spelling, or length (unless those are targeted goals).

---

### 2.3 Oral Language, Presentations, & Verbal Demonstrations

**Goals:** leverage speaking and listening as valid ways to show understanding.

Adaptation options:
- Replace or supplement written tasks with:
  - **1:1 conferences**,
  - recorded audio/video explanations,
  - small-group discussions,
  - oral quizzes.
- Allow **presentation flexibility**:
  - present to teacher or small group instead of whole class,
  - use notes or visual prompts,
  - pre-record instead of live.
- Provide:
  - question prompts in advance,
  - clear structure: intro → 2 points → conclusion.
- For students with communication differences:
  - accept AAC, gestures, visuals, or partner-assisted communication.

Assessment focus:
- Evaluate content and reasoning, not confidence, volume, or performance style (unless explicitly part of the outcome).

---

### 2.4 Hands-On, Practical, and Experiential Learning

**Goals:** honour BC’s emphasis on inquiry, labs, making, field studies, and applied skills.

Adaptation options:
- Prioritize **manipulatives and models**:
  - blocks, fraction strips, algebra tiles,
  - science models, maps, timelines.
- Provide **guided lab / inquiry templates**:
  - question → prediction → steps → quick observations → conclusion.
- Let students:
  - build, sort, match, or classify to show understanding.
  - act out processes (e.g., particle motion, historical events, forces).
- Scaffold safety and procedure:
  - visual lab rules,
  - checklists for steps.

Assessment focus:
- Look for ability to follow process, make observations, and connect to concept.
- Written lab reports can be shortened or replaced with labeled photos, checklists, or oral explanations.

---

### 2.5 Visual, Organizational & Executive Function Supports

**Goals:** reduce barriers from working memory, organization, attention, or anxiety.

Adaptation options:
- Clear daily **agenda** and chunked instructions.
- **Checklists** for multi-step tasks.
- Visual timers; flexible seating; reduced visual clutter.
- **Extended time** or split deadlines.
- Option to work in a **quiet space** or with headphones.
- Colour-coding:
  - subjects,
  - steps,
  - sections of notes.
- Frequent, low-key check-ins:
  - “Show me step 1 before you move on.”

These are core UDL/inclusive strategies and should be standard, not exceptional.

## 3. SUBJECT-ALIGNED ADAPTATION MENUS (GENERAL)

Below are cross-grade, non-assignment-specific adaptations consistent with BC curriculum structures.

### 3.1 English Language Arts (K–12)

Key curriculum elements include **reading, listening, viewing, writing, speaking, representing** as interconnected modes.

Adaptation examples:
- Multiple text formats: print, digital, audio, graphic, oral storytelling.
- Choice of response:
  - paragraph, point form, comic, podcast, dramatization.
- For literary analysis:
  - provide teacher-selected quotes;
  - ask students to comment on meaning rather than locate all evidence alone.
- For extended research/essays:
  - use curated resource sets;
  - reduce the number of sources; focus on interpretation and synthesis.

Maintain:
- Same Big Ideas (e.g., language shapes identity, texts construct meaning).
- Adjust complexity and volume as needed.

---

### 3.2 Mathematics (K–12)

BC numeracy emphasizes reasoning, modeling, and multiple representations.

Adaptation examples:
- Use **visual and concrete tools**:
  - number lines, grids, base-ten blocks, fraction models, algebra tiles.
- Encourage:
  - drawing diagrams,
  - creating tables,
  - mapping steps.
- Allow:
  - fewer but higher-quality questions,
  - calculator use when computation is not the goal.
- Connect to real contexts:
  - student interests, nature, sports, money, design.
- Permit verbal explanation of strategy (recorded or 1:1) instead of fully written solutions, when appropriate.

Maintain:
- Focus on understanding patterns, relationships, and reasoning, not only speed or volume.

---

### 3.3 Science (K–12)

Science curriculum values **questioning, predicting, planning, conducting, processing, analyzing, and communicating**.

Adaptation examples:
- Narrow **content focus**:
  - instead of “entire ecosystems,” focus on one organism’s role;
  - instead of “whole solar system,” focus on one planet’s features and interactions.
- Provide structured lab/report templates:
  - fill-in-the-blank sections,
  - word banks,
  - checklists for variables and safety.
- Use:
  - diagrams, labeled pictures, flow charts,
  - teacher-collected data instead of student measurement when needed.
- Accept alternate communication:
  - oral explanations,
  - slide/poster with key points,
  - concept maps.

Maintain:
- Big Ideas (e.g., matter, energy, ecosystems) while letting depth/complexity vary.

---

### 3.4 Social Studies (K–12)

Social Studies emphasizes **inquiry, evidence, cause & consequence, perspective, ethics**.

Adaptation examples:
- Use **shorter, leveled readings** plus visuals (maps, charts, timelines).
- Provide:
  - guiding questions on events/people,
  - partially completed graphic organizers.
- Offer product choices:
  - short paragraph,
  - annotated timeline,
  - comic strip,
  - podcast-style recording,
  - interview script.
- Support perspective-taking with:
  - sentence frames (“From their point of view…”, “A consequence was…”),
  - role cards.

Maintain:
- Historical and geographic thinking competencies; reduce length and reading load, not core reasoning.

---

## 4. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATIONS (CROSS-CURRICULAR)

Adaptations for assessment must still allow demonstration of the **same learning standards** unless IEP specifies modification.

Options:
- Oral assessments instead of (or in addition to) written tests.
- Open-book or reference sheets for students with memory challenges.
- Multiple smaller quizzes instead of one large high-stakes test.
- Projects, demonstrations, conferences, and portfolios as valid evidence.
- Adjusted weighting:
  - reduce impact of spelling/handwriting where not part of the standard.
- Alternative quiet/low-distraction setting.

When adjustments change **what** is being assessed (e.g., expecting different outcomes), document as **modification** in the IEP.

---

## 5. HOW TO IMPLEMENT (PRACTICAL)

1. **Scan the IEP**  
   - Identify if student is on **adapted** program (grade-level outcomes) or **modified**.
2. **Select 3–7 adaptations**  
   - From the sections above that directly target the student’s learning profile.
3. **Make them visible**
   - Add to IEP; share with all classroom teachers; embed in daily routines.
4. **Keep consistent, not one-off**
   - Use across tasks, not just on tests.
5. **Review**
   - If student still cannot show learning with adaptations, consider:
     - different adaptations,
     - or whether modifications are required.
