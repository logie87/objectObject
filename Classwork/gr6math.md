## NUMBER SENSE & PROBLEM SOLVING SNAPSHOT – 1 WEEK ASSIGNMENT
Teacher + Student Markdown Edition

---

## SECTION A: TEACHER OVERVIEW

### Title
**Number Sense & Problem Solving Snapshot (Math 6)**

### Timeframe
**1 week**

### Purpose

A short, focused assignment to see how well students can:

- Work with core Grade 6 number concepts (whole numbers, decimals, fractions, and percentages).
- Choose and use strategies (models, mental math, written methods) to solve problems.
- Explain their thinking in clear, simple language.
- Show their reasoning on at least one multi-step “real world” task.

Designed to be:

- Completed in one week of regular classes.
- Easy to scale up/down for different learners and IEPs.
- Friendly to both paper and digital formats.

### Core Components (Suggested)

1. **Check-In & Practice Set** – completion  
2. **Number Sense Snapshot Page** – 20 marks  
3. **Problem Solving Task (Real-World)** – 20 marks  
4. **Mini Math Talk (Strategy Share)** – 10 marks  

**Total Suggested:** 50 marks (adjust as needed)

### Recommended Week Flow

- **Day 1:** Introduce snapshot; quick check-in questions; assign practice.
- **Day 2:** Work on Number Sense Snapshot Page (in class).
- **Day 3–4:** Work on Problem Solving Task; teacher support & conferencing.
- **Day 5:** Mini Math Talks; collect all work.

### Topics Covered (Adjustable)

Suggested coverage aligned with typical Grade 6 outcomes:

- Place value (up to at least 1 000 000; decimals to thousandths).
- Adding & subtracting decimals.
- Multiplying whole numbers & basic decimal multiplication.
- Fractions as parts of a set, equivalent fractions, simple fraction/decimal/percent links.
- Interpreting word problems and choosing operations.

### Submission Expectations

Students submit:

- **Check-In & Practice** (may be marked for completion).
- **Number Sense Snapshot Page** (core skills).
- **Problem Solving Task** (with visible reasoning).
- Participation in **Mini Math Talk**.

### Marking Focus (Teacher Summary)

**Number Sense Snapshot (20)**  
- Accuracy on core questions.
- Correct use of place value, operations, and decimal/fraction representations.
- Clear work shown.

**Problem Solving Task (20)**  
- Chooses reasonable operations and strategies.
- Shows steps and thinking.
- Explains solution in words or labeled work.

**Mini Math Talk (10)**  
- Brief, clear explanation of strategy.
- Uses correct math language at a Grade 6 level.

### IEP / Differentiation Options

You may:

- Reduce the number of questions.
- Offer multiple-choice or matching instead of open response for some.
- Allow calculator for certain parts (focus on reasoning, not arithmetic).
- Provide visual aids, number lines, grids, or manipulatives.
- Scribe or allow oral explanations instead of written sentences.
- Extend for advanced students with more complex multi-step tasks.

All students follow the same core flow:
**Check-In → Core Skills → Real Problem → Share Strategy**

## SECTION B: STUDENT ASSIGNMENT

### Title
**Number Sense & Problem Solving Snapshot – Grade 6**

### Time
**1 week**

You will:

1. Do a short **check-in** and practice.  
2. Complete a **Number Sense Snapshot Page**.  
3. Solve one **real-world math problem** and show your thinking.  
4. Share a **quick Math Talk** about how you solved one question.

Your teacher will give you due dates.

---

## PART 1: CHECK-IN & PRACTICE (COMPLETION)

Your teacher will give you a half-page or one-page warm-up.

It may include:
- A large number to read and write.
- A decimal to place on a number line.
- A quick fraction/percent match.
- One short word problem.

Finish it honestly. This is to help your teacher see what you remember.

---

## PART 2: NUMBER SENSE SNAPSHOT PAGE (20 MARKS)

Answer the questions your teacher gives you on the Snapshot Page.
Below is a sample structure (your teacher may adjust the exact numbers).

### Sample Structure

1. **Place Value**
   - Write 508 230 in words.
   - Circle the digit in the **thousandths** place in 3.406.
   - Write a number between 5.2 and 5.3.

2. **Compare & Order**
   - Put these in order from least to greatest: 0.7, 0.57, 0.705.
   - Use <, >, or = : 3/4 __ 0.75

3. **Operations with Decimals**
   - 4.6 + 2.35 =  
   - 7.5 − 3.28 =  

4. **Multiplication / Division**
   - 36 × 7 =  
   - 480 ÷ 6 =  
   - (Challenge/optional) 2.5 × 4 =  

5. **Fractions & Percents**
   - Shade 3/5 of a 10-square grid. How many squares?  
   - 50% of 18 =  
   - 1/4 as a decimal =

Students **must show some work** (except on simple comparison questions).

**Marked On (20):**

- Mostly correct answers.
- Neat, organized layout.
- Evidence of thinking (not random guesses).

## PART 3: PROBLEM SOLVING TASK (20 MARKS)

Choose ONE of the following tasks (your teacher may assign one).

You must:
- Show your work.
- Write a short explanation sentence or two.

### Option A: Field Trip Snacks

Your class has **24 students**.

Each snack pack costs **$1.75**.

1. How much will it cost to buy a snack pack for every student?  
2. If your budget is **$50**, do you have enough? Explain.

### Option B: Class Fundraiser

You are selling buttons for **$2.50** each.

On Day 1 you sell 8.  
On Day 2 you sell 12.  
On Day 3 you sell 6.

1. How many buttons in total?  
2. How much money did you make altogether?

### Option C: Water Bottle Fractions

A water bottle holds **600 mL**.

You drink **1/3** of it in the morning and **1/4** in the afternoon.

1. How much did you drink in total?  
2. How much water is left?

**Marked On (20):**

- Correct or reasonable operations chosen.
- Work is shown step by step (numbers, diagrams, or words).
- Explanation sentence makes sense (“I multiplied because…”, “I added fractions because…”).

Minor arithmetic slips are okay if the reasoning is clear.

---

## PART 4: MINI MATH TALK (10 MARKS)

Length: about **1–2 minutes**.

Choose ONE question from your work (Snapshot or Problem Solving).

In your Math Talk, you must:

1. State the question you solved.  
2. Explain how you solved it (step by step).  
3. Say why your strategy makes sense.

You can:
- Use your page as a guide.
- Draw a quick model on the board or paper.

- Clear explanation.
- Uses math words (add, multiply, fraction, decimal, etc.).
- Stays on topic.
