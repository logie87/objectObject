\# Assignment Outline: Cuba’s Communist History – Focused Inquiry Presentation

\#\# Overview (Teacher-Facing)

\*\*Subject:\*\* Social Studies    
\*\*Focus:\*\* Political/economic systems, human rights, global interdependence    
\*\*Format:\*\* Short, research-based presentation    
\*\*Intended Use:\*\* Base template for LLM to adapt per student IEP while maintaining core outcomes.

Students investigate Cuba’s communist history through one focused lens. They must use at least one peer-reviewed article plus other credible sources, then present a clear, evidence-based argument.

The LLM may simplify language, chunk steps, adjust product format, or pre-fill structure based on IEP data, but should not change core learning goals.

\#\# Learning Goals (BC Social Studies-Aligned)

Students will:

\- Describe key events leading to and sustaining communist rule in Cuba.  
\- Analyze how ideology and policy impact people and systems.  
\- Use evidence from peer-reviewed and credible sources.  
\- Communicate findings in an organized, audience-appropriate presentation.

Targeted curricular competencies:

\- Use Social Studies inquiry processes (questioning, researching, analyzing).  
\- Demonstrate understanding of political and economic systems.  
\- Assess continuity and change, cause and consequence, and differing perspectives.  
\- Use evidence to support interpretations.

\#\# Research Requirements

Baseline (LLM may scaffold, not remove):

\- At least \*\*1–2 additional credible sources\*\*, such as:  
  \- Academic or governmental sites  
  \- Established news organizations  
  \- Historical institutes or NGOs

Expectations:

\- Extract specific facts, statistics, or findings.  
\- Connect each major point in the presentation to a cited source.  
\- Avoid relying on unsourced opinion, generic AI output, or low-credibility sites.

\#\# Student Task (Base Instructions)

\*\*Task Statement (core template):\*\*

Create a focused presentation on:

\> “How has Cuba’s communist system affected \[chosen focus area\]?”

Your presentation must:

\- Briefly explain how Cuba became a communist state.

  \- At least two supported drawbacks/harms or limitations.  
\- End with a conclusion answering:  
  \- “Overall, what has been the impact of Cuba’s communist system in this area?”

\*\*Permitted formats\*\* (to be restricted/expanded by teacher or IEP/LLM):

\- 5–8 slide deck with brief speaker notes.  
\- 3–5 minute live or recorded presentation with visual support.  
\- For some learners (per IEP): structured poster, guided script, storyboard, or teacher-supported conference.

\#\# Recommended Structure

Use or adapt this structure:

1\. \*\*Title\*\*  
   \- Topic, chosen lens, student name, date, course.

2\. \*\*Background\*\*  
   \- 2–4 key points:  
     \- Pre-1959 context  
     \- 1959 Revolution

3\. \*\*Focus Area Explanation\*\*  
   \- Define the selected lens.  
   \- Identify key policies, events, or themes related to this lens.

4\. \*\*Evidence and Analysis\*\*  
   \- Present findings from peer-reviewed and credible sources.  
   \- Show supported benefits/strengths.  
   \- Show supported drawbacks/harms.  
   \- Make clear links between evidence and claims.

5\. \*\*Conclusion\*\*  
   \- Clear position:  
     \- Mostly beneficial / mostly harmful / mixed outcome  
   \- 1–3 key reasons based on presented evidence.

6\. \*\*Works Cited\*\*  
   \- Simple, consistent format:  
     \- Author, year, title, source.  
   \- Model correct attribution; do not overcomplicate for younger learners.

\#\# LLM Adaptation Notes (For System / Teacher, Not Student)

When generating a student-specific version:

\- Read from IEP JSON:  
  \- Grade level  
  \- Reading/writing levels or goals  
  \- Attention/processing needs  
  \- Anxiety/communication needs  
  \- Required accommodations (technology, reduced load, alternative formats)  
  \- Strengths and interest areas

\- Adjust:  
  \- Reading level of instructions.  
  \- Number of required examples (e.g., 1–2 instead of 4).  
  \- Presentation length (e.g., 3 slides vs. 8).  
  \- Format options (oral, recorded, scribed, visual-heavy).  
  \- Scaffolded tools:  
    \- Step-by-step checklist  
    \- Sentence frames  
    \- Pre-structured slide outline  
    \- Graphic organizer prompts

\- Preserve:  
  \- Core content focus on Cuba’s communist history.  
  \- Requirement to engage with at least one high-quality / peer-reviewed source (with support where needed).  
  \- Connection to BC Social Studies competencies.
