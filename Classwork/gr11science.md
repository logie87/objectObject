# GRADE 11 PHYSICS  
## MOTION & FORCES SNAPSHOT – 1 WEEK INVESTIGATION  
Teacher + Student Markdown Edition

---

## SECTION A: TEACHER OVERVIEW

### Title
**Motion & Forces Snapshot (Physics 11)**

### Timeframe
**1 week**

### Purpose

A compact assignment to assess whether students can:

- Design or interpret a simple motion/forces situation.
- Collect or use data (measured or provided) in a structured way.
- Apply core Physics 11 concepts (e.g., kinematics, Newton's laws, force diagrams).
- Perform basic calculations with correct units and significant figures.
- Communicate findings clearly in one short report plus a brief explanation.

Designed to be:

- Completed within one week of classes.
- Usable after or during an intro unit on kinematics and forces.
- Easy to adapt (lab-based, video/data-based, or fully provided dataset).
- Straightforward to modify for IEPs and different readiness levels.

### Core Components (Suggested)

1. **Scenario Choice + Plan Check-in** – completion  
2. **Data & Calculations Section** – 20 marks  
3. **Analysis & Explanation Section** – 20 marks  
4. **Mini Summary (Verbal or Written)** – 10 marks  

**Total Suggested:** 50 marks (adjust as needed)

### Recommended Week Flow

- **Day 1:** Introduce task, show example, students choose scenario and confirm plan.
- **Day 2:** Run simple experiment *or* analyze provided data / video.
- **Day 3:** Complete Data & Calculations section.
- **Day 4:** Write Analysis & Explanation section.
- **Day 5:** Quick 1–2 minute summaries and final submission.

### Scenario Options (Teacher-Determined)

Choose ONE of the following models (or mix):

1. **Lab-Based:**  
   - Rolling cart/ball down a ramp.  
   - Motion on a flat surface with ticker timer / motion sensor / video.  
   - Measure distance vs time, estimate velocity, maybe acceleration.

2. **Video/Data-Based:**  
   - Use a teacher-provided motion video (e.g., ball toss, car, runner).  
   - Students extract position-time or velocity-time data from given table or graph.

3. **Fully Provided Dataset:**  
   - Provide a clean table of distance-time (or velocity-time) data.
   - Students focus on interpreting and explaining, not measuring.

### Submission Expectations

Students submit in one document (digital or paper):

- Scenario choice + short description.
- Data & Calculations table(s).
- Analysis & Explanation answers.
- A short summary statement (for the mini share).

### Marking Focus (Teacher Summary)

**Data & Calculations (20)**  
- Correct or reasonable use of formulas (v = Δd/Δt, a = Δv/Δt, F = ma where applicable).
- Organized table(s).
- Units included; sig figs reasonable for level.

**Analysis & Explanation (20)**  
- Consistent story: what happened, what the numbers show.
- References Newton’s laws / motion concepts accurately.
- Identifies at least one possible source of error or limitation.

**Mini Summary (10)**  
- Clear, concise restatement of findings.
- Uses correct terminology at least briefly (e.g., constant velocity, acceleration, net force).

### IEP / Differentiation Options

You may:

- Provide partially completed tables or formulas.
- Allow calculator support, peer pairing, or scribing.
- Provide the data instead of having them measure.
- Simplify expectations (only constant velocity; skip acceleration/forces).
- Extend for strong students (vector directions, multiple intervals, FBDs, comparing models).

All students follow the same structure:
**Choose/Observe → Record → Calculate → Explain → Summarize**

## SECTION B: STUDENT ASSIGNMENT

### Title
**Motion & Forces Snapshot – Physics 11**

### Time
**1 week**

You will:

1. Choose or use a simple motion/forces scenario given by your teacher.  
2. Record or use data for that situation.  
3. Do a small set of calculations.  
4. Explain what your results mean about the motion and forces.  
5. Share a short summary of your findings.

Your teacher will tell you which scenario to use and the due date.

---

## PART 1: SCENARIO CHOICE (CHECK-IN)

By the end of Day 1, you must have:

- A chosen scenario (from your teacher’s options), for example:
  - A cart rolling down a ramp.
  - A ball rolling along a table.
  - A runner or toy car in a straight line.
  - A provided data table or motion graph.
- A quick plan for how you will get or use data.

**Submit (or tell your teacher):**

- **Scenario description (1–2 sentences)**  
- **What data you will use** (distance-time, velocity-time, etc.)

Example:  
“I will time a toy car moving 1.0 m on the floor three times and record the times.”

---

## PART 2: DATA & CALCULATIONS (20 MARKS)

Use the template below (adapt as needed).

### 1. Raw Data Table

Record your measurements OR copy the provided data.

Example structure:

| Trial | Distance (m) | Time (s) |
|------|--------------|---------|
| 1    |              |         |
| 2    |              |         |
| 3    |              |         |

Or, if using multiple positions:

| Point | Position (m) | Time (s) |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| A     |              |         |
| B     |              |         |
| C     |              |         |

### 2. Average Time / Velocity

If timing repeated runs:

- Calculate **average time**.  
- Use `v = Δd / Δt` to find **average velocity**.

If you have position-time data for multiple points:

- Find velocity between intervals.

Example:

`v = (d2 - d1) / (t2 - t1)`

### 3. (Optional / If Assigned) Acceleration or Force

If your teacher asks:

- Use `a = Δv / Δt` to estimate acceleration.  
- If mass is given and motion is due to net force, use `F = m a` to estimate net force.

**Marked On (20):**

- Data is recorded clearly.
- Calculations are shown (not just answers).
- Units are included.
- Numbers are reasonable for your scenario.

---

## PART 3: ANALYSIS & EXPLANATION (20 MARKS)

Answer in clear sentences or short paragraphs.

### 1. Describe the Motion

In **3–5 sentences**:

- What did your object do?
- Was its velocity mostly constant or changing?
- Use your data to support your answer.

Example:  
“Our cart’s velocity was about 0.40 m/s each trial, so we can say it moved at roughly constant velocity.”

### 2. Connect to Physics Ideas

In **4–6 sentences**:

Mention at least one of:

- **Constant velocity** (balanced forces, no net force).  
- **Acceleration** (unbalanced forces, speeding up or slowing down).  
- **Newton’s First Law** (object keeps doing what it’s doing unless net force).  
- **Newton’s Second Law** (more force → more acceleration for same mass).

Explain how your data fits one of these ideas.

### 3. Sources of Error / Limitations

In **2–4 sentences**:

- Name at least one thing that could affect your results:
  - Reaction time, rough surface, measurement error, not starting/stopping timer exactly, etc.
- Briefly say how it might change the numbers.

**Marked On (20):**

- Uses correct concepts at a basic Physics 11 level.
- Links data to ideas (not just random formulas).
- Shows awareness that real data is not perfect.

## PART 4: MINI SUMMARY (10 MARKS)

Prepare a **1–2 minute** summary.

In your summary, state:

1. What scenario you used.  
2. One key number (average velocity, or acceleration, etc.).  
3. What that number tells you about the motion.  
4. One physics idea it connects to (e.g., constant velocity, net force).  

You may:

- Read from a small cue card.
- Show your data table or a quick sketch/graph.

**Marked On (10):**

- Short, clear, and on topic.
- Uses at least one correct physics term.
- Matches what you wrote in your report.
