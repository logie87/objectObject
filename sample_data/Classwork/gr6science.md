# GRADE 6 SCIENCE  
## EGG DROP ENGINEERING SNAPSHOT – 1 WEEK ASSIGNMENT  
Teacher + Student Markdown Edition

---

## SECTION A: TEACHER OVERVIEW

### Title
**Egg Drop Engineering Snapshot (Science 6)**

### Timeframe
**1 week**

### Purpose

A short STEM assignment to assess how students can:

- Use the **scientific method** and **engineering design process**.
- Apply basic ideas about **forces, gravity, impact, and materials**.
- Plan, build, test, and reflect on an egg-protection device.
- Communicate their thinking in a simple written report plus a brief share-out.

Designed to be:

- Completed in one week of classes.
- Hands-on, engaging, and low-cost.
- Easy to modify for IEPs and mixed abilities.
- Connected to BC Science 6 skills (questioning, predicting, planning, testing, analyzing, reflecting).

### Core Components (Suggested)

1. **Design Plan Check-in** – completion  
2. **Build & Drop Test** – completion / observation  
3. **Egg Drop Snapshot Report (written)** – 25 marks  
4. **Reflection & Improvement Idea** – 15 marks  
5. **Mini Presentation / Gallery Walk** – 10 marks  

**Total Suggested:** 50 marks (adjust as needed)

### Recommended Week Flow

- **Day 1:** Introduce challenge, safety rules, constraints; students sketch and submit a plan.
- **Day 2–3:** Build devices (in class or partly at home).
- **Day 4:** Drop test day; record results.
- **Day 5:** Complete written Snapshot Report, Reflection, and quick share-out.

### Suggested Constraints (Editable)

- Use only teacher-approved materials (e.g., straws, tape, paper, cardboard, string, cups, etc.).
- Maximum size (e.g., must fit in a 30cm x 30cm x 30cm box).
- No parachutes larger than a set size (if desired).
- No liquids, food mess, or dangerous materials.
- One raw egg per drop test (or as allowed).

### Submission Expectations

Students submit:

- **Design Plan** (sketch + short explanation).
- **Egg Drop Snapshot Report** (one-page style).
- **Reflection & Improvement** section.
- Participation in **Mini Presentation / Gallery Walk**.

### Marking Focus (Teacher Summary)

**Egg Drop Snapshot Report (25)**  
- Clear description of design.
- Simple explanation of how it is supposed to protect the egg.
- Includes test result and observations.

**Reflection & Improvement (15)**  
- Explains what worked / didn’t.
- Suggests a reasonable improvement with some science reasoning.
- Uses age-appropriate vocabulary (force, gravity, cushion, absorb, protect).

**Mini Presentation (10)**  
- Brief, organized explanation.
- Uses correct basic terms.
- Shows engagement and understanding.

### IEP / Differentiation Options

You may:

- Allow:
  - Pair or group work.
  - Teacher/EA or peer scribing.
  - Sentence stems, word banks, labeled diagrams instead of long paragraphs.
- Adjust:
  - Writing expectations (fewer sentences).
  - Complexity of science vocabulary focus.
- Pre-build:
  - Provide base designs for some students to modify.
- Extend:
  - Ask advanced students to calculate drop height, estimate speed, or compare two designs.

All students follow the same core flow:
**Plan → Build → Test → Explain → Reflect**

## SECTION B: STUDENT ASSIGNMENT

### Title
**Egg Drop Engineering Snapshot – Grade 6 Science**

### Time
**1 week**

You will:

1. **Design** a device to protect a raw egg when dropped.  
2. **Build and test** your device.  
3. **Record** what happened.  
4. **Explain and reflect** on your design and your results.  
5. **Share** your design with the class.

Your teacher will explain the rules, drop height, and due dates.

---

## PART 1: DESIGN PLAN (CHECK-IN)

Due: **Day 1**

In your notebook or on the template, write:

1. **Sketch of your design**
   - Draw your egg-protection device.
   - Label main parts (e.g., “cushion,” “parachute,” “support frame”).

2. **Short Explanation (3–5 sentences)**
   - What materials will you use?
   - How is your design supposed to protect the egg?
     - (e.g., slow it down, spread out the force, cushion the landing)

Turn this in before you start building.

---

## PART 2: BUILD & DROP TEST

**Days 2–4**

- Build your design using allowed materials.
- When your teacher says it is time, you will:
  - Place the egg in your device.
  - Drop it from the chosen height (e.g., balcony, ladder, or desk).
  - After the drop, carefully check the egg.

Record:
- Did the egg **survive** (no cracks)?  
- **Minor crack**, or **total smash**?  
- Any other observations (did it flip, land sideways, parachute open, etc.)?

Your teacher may run multiple drops or heights.

---

## PART 3: EGG DROP SNAPSHOT REPORT (25 MARKS)

Fill this out after the test. Use clear sentences or bullet points.

### 1. Basic Info

- **Your Name(s):**  
- **Date of Drop:**  
- **Drop Height:** (if given)

### 2. Design Description (4–6 sentences)

Explain your design in words:

- What did you build?  
- What materials did you use?  
- How was the egg held in place?  
- How was the landing supposed to be made safer?

### 3. Science Idea (3–5 sentences)

Use some of these words if you can: **gravity, force, impact, cushion, absorb, slow down, protect**.

Explain:

- What happens to the egg when it falls (because of gravity)?  
- How your design tried to:
  - slow the egg down, or
  - spread out the force, or
  - add padding so the egg does not feel all the impact at once.

### 4. Test Result (2–3 sentences)

- What happened to your egg? (safe, cracked, broken)  
- Did your device work the way you expected?

**Marked On (25):**

- Clear description of design.
- Basic use of science words or ideas.
- Accurate report of what happened.

---

## PART 4: REFLECTION & IMPROVEMENT (15 MARKS)

Answer in complete sentences or labeled bullets.

### 1. What Worked? (2–3 sentences)

- Name one part of your design that helped protect the egg (or almost did).
- Explain why you think it helped.

### 2. What Didn’t Work? (2–3 sentences)

- Name one part that did **not** work well.
- Explain what went wrong (too hard, too loose, too heavy, not enough cushion, etc.).

### 3. What Would You Change? (3–5 sentences)

If you could rebuild:

- What is **one change** you would make?
- Why would this change help reduce the force or protect the egg better?

Try to link your idea to:
- making the fall slower,
- adding more padding,
- or spreading out the impact.

**Marked On (15):**

- Honest reflection.
- At least one realistic improvement.
- Some science thinking behind the change.

---

## PART 5: MINI PRESENTATION / GALLERY SHARE (10 MARKS)

Length: about **1–2 minutes**.

During the gallery walk or class share, you will:

1. Show your device (or a photo/sketch if it broke).  
2. Say:
   - What your idea was.
   - What happened to the egg.
   - One thing you would change next time and why.

You do **not** need a long speech.

**Marked On (10):**

- Speaks clearly enough for others to hear.
- Shares the main points.
- Shows understanding of their own design.
