## SECTION A: TEACHER OVERVIEW

### Title
**Literary Voices Snapshot (ELA 11)**

### Timeframe
**1 week**

### Purpose

A short, focused assignment to assess how students can:

- Read and understand a Grade 11-level literary text (short story, poem set, or novel excerpt).
- Identify and explain key elements: voice, character, conflict, theme, and one or two stylistic choices.
- Make a personal or contemporary connection to the text.
- Communicate their understanding clearly in a concise written product plus a brief oral component.

Designed to be:

- Completed in one week within regular class blocks.
- Easy to differentiate and adapt for IEPs.
- Aligned with senior ELA outcomes: critical reading, interpretation, voice, and synthesis.

### Core Components (Suggested)

1. **Text Selection + Check-in** – completion  
2. **Literary Snapshot Brief (written)** – 30 marks  
3. **Theme, Voice, and Connection Task** – 15 marks  
4. **Mini Talk: “Why This Voice Matters”** – 10 marks  

**Total Suggested:** 55 marks (adjust to your system)

### Recommended Week Flow

- **Day 1:** Introduce task; assign or approve texts; model an example.
- **Day 2:** Reading / re-reading in class; guided annotations.
- **Day 3:** Draft Literary Snapshot Brief.
- **Day 4:** Complete Theme, Voice, and Connection section; refine.
- **Day 5:** Mini talks and final submission.

### Text Options

You may choose:

- One **common class text** (e.g., a short story or themed text set).
- A **choice** model:
  - Students select from a curated list of short stories, poems, or novel excerpts at appropriate rigor.
- For IEP / ELL:
  - Same anchor theme, adjusted text complexity (parallel texts).

### Submission Expectations

Students submit:

- Approved **text choice** (if using options).
- **Literary Snapshot Brief** (1–2 pages).
- **Theme, Voice, and Connection** section (in the same document).
- Delivery of **Mini Talk** (2–3 minutes; live or recorded).

### Marking Focus (Teacher Summary)

**Literary Snapshot Brief (30)**

- Identification of key literary elements (character, conflict, setting as needed).  
- Clear, concise, structured writing.

**Theme, Voice, and Connection (15)**  
- Reasonable interpretation of theme.  
- Comment on narrative voice or key stylistic move (e.g., imagery, tone, structure).

### IEP / Differentiation Options

  - Conferencing in place of some written components.
- Focus:
  - On comprehension + one analytical move (theme OR voice) rather than many.
- Extend:
  - Ask strong students to compare two texts or incorporate critical lenses.

Maintain common structure:
