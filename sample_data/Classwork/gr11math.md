## FUNCTIONS & QUADRATICS SNAPSHOT – 1 WEEK ASSIGNMENT  
Teacher + Student Markdown Edition

---

## SECTION A: TEACHER OVERVIEW

### Title
**Functions & Quadratics Snapshot (Pre-Calculus 11)**

### Timeframe
**1 week**

### Purpose

A compact assignment to check key Pre-Calculus 11 skills:

- Understanding of **functions & notation**.
- Working with **linear and quadratic functions** in equation, table, and graph form.
- Interpreting key features (intercepts, vertex, domain/range, rate of change).
- Applying concepts to one real-world style problem.
- Communicating reasoning clearly and concisely.

Designed to be:

- Completed in ~5 classes.
- Low marking load, high signal.
- Easy to adapt for IEPs and mixed readiness.

### Core Components (Suggested)

1. **Concept Check-In (Functions & Notation)** – completion  
2. **Functions Snapshot Page (Core Skills)** – 25 marks  
3. **Quadratic Application Task** – 20 marks  
4. **Mini Function Talk (Strategy / Interpretation)** – 10 marks  

**Total Suggested:** 55 marks (adjust as needed)

### Recommended Week Flow

- **Day 1:** Concept Check-In; review gaps; assign Snapshot.
- **Day 2:** Work on Functions Snapshot Page (in class).
- **Day 3–4:** Work on Quadratic Application Task; conferencing.
- **Day 5:** Mini Function Talks; collect all written work.

### Content Focus

Adjust to match your pacing; suggested:

- Function notation: f(x), input/output.
- Linear functions: slope, intercepts, graphs.
- Quadratic functions: standard form y = ax² + bx + c and/or vertex form.
- Key features: zeros, vertex, axis of symmetry, opens up/down.
- Basic transformations (vertical/horizontal shift, reflection) if covered.

### Submission Expectations

Students submit:

- **Check-In** (for diagnostic / completion).
- **Functions Snapshot Page** (short skills set).
- **Quadratic Application Task** (with full reasoning).
- Participation in **Mini Function Talk**.

### Marking Focus (Teacher Summary)

**Functions Snapshot (25)**  
- Correct use of function notation.  
- Accurate evaluation of functions.  
- Correct identification/graphing of linear & quadratic features.  
- Work is shown and organized.

**Quadratic Application (20)**  
- Reasonable model/equation (if required).  
- Correct or defensible calculations.  
- Clear explanation of what the answer means.

**Mini Function Talk (10)**  
- Brief, accurate explanation of one problem.  
- Uses appropriate math vocabulary.

### IEP / Differentiation Options

You may:

- Reduce number of questions.
- Allow formula/reference sheet.
- Allow calculator use for arithmetic.
- Focus grading on concept recognition (e.g., identifying features from given graphs).
- For support: give partially-completed graphs/tables, multiple choice, or structured steps.
- For extension: include transformations, inequalities, or system comparisons.

Maintain common structure:
**Check-In → Core Skills → Application → Verbal Justification**

## SECTION B: STUDENT ASSIGNMENT

### Title
**Functions & Quadratics Snapshot – Pre-Calculus 11**

### Time
**1 week**

You will:

1. Complete a short **Check-In** so your teacher sees what you remember.  
2. Finish the **Functions Snapshot Page** (core questions).  
3. Solve one **Quadratic Application Task** with full working.  
4. Do a **2–3 minute Function Talk** explaining one question.

Your teacher will give you exact due dates.

---

## PART 1: CONCEPT CHECK-IN (COMPLETION)

Your teacher will give you a short page to see what you know about:

- Function notation (f(x)).  
- Linear vs non-linear.  
- Reading a simple graph.

Do your best. This part is mainly for your teacher to plan help.

---

## PART 2: FUNCTIONS SNAPSHOT PAGE (25 MARKS)

Your teacher will provide the exact questions. A sample structure is below.

Show your work.

### 1. Function Notation

1. If f(x) = 3x − 5, find:
   - a) f(0)
   - b) f(4)

2. If g(x) = x² + 2x, find:
   - a) g(−1)
   - b) g(3)

### 2. Linear Functions

3. A line has slope m = 2 and y-intercept 3.
   - a) Write its equation.
   - b) Find y when x = 5.

4. From the graph (teacher-provided), state:
   - a) the slope
   - b) the y-intercept

### 3. Quadratic Basics

5. For y = x² − 4x + 3:
   - a) Find the y-intercept.
   - b) Find the zeros (by factoring).
   - c) State the axis of symmetry.
   - d) State the vertex.

6. For y = −2(x − 1)² + 5:
   - a) Does it open up or down?
   - b) What is the vertex?

**Marked On (25):**

- Correct use of notation.
- Accurate calculations and feature identification.
- Steps and work are shown.

## PART 3: QUADRATIC APPLICATION TASK (20 MARKS)

Choose ONE of the following tasks (or use the one assigned by your teacher).

Show all work and write a sentence to explain what your answer means.

### Option A: Projectile Path

A ball is thrown upward from a platform. Its height (in metres) after t seconds is:

> h(t) = −5t² + 10t + 3

1. Find the height at t = 0 (what does this represent?).  
2. Find the maximum height of the ball (use vertex).  
3. Estimate when the ball hits the ground (solve h(t) = 0; you may round).

Explain in one or two sentences what your answers mean in context.

### Option B: Profit Model

A school club sells tickets for a show. The profit P(x) in dollars, where x is the number of $5 price decreases from the original price, is:

> P(x) = −100x² + 400x

1. Find P(0) and P(2).  
2. Find the value of x that gives the maximum profit (vertex).  
3. State the maximum profit.

Explain what this suggests about ticket pricing.

### Option C: Design Problem (Parabola)

A decorative archway is modeled by:

> y = −(x − 3)² + 9

where y is the height (m) and x is the horizontal distance (m) from the left base.

1. What is the maximum height of the arch?  
2. What are the x-intercepts (where the arch meets the ground)?  
3. What is the total width of the arch?

Explain what each answer means for the actual structure.

**Marked On (20):**

- Correct use of quadratic skills: vertex, intercepts, evaluating.
- Logical steps, labeled.
- Final answers stated with context (units, meaning).

Minor arithmetic errors are less serious than reasoning errors.

## PART 4: MINI FUNCTION TALK (10 MARKS)

Length: **2–3 minutes**.

Choose ONE question from Part 2 or Part 3.

In your talk:

1. State the original question.  
2. Walk through how you solved it (step-by-step).  
3. Explain why your method works (link to function/graph/vertex/etc.).  
4. State the final answer clearly.

You may:
- Present at the board,
- Use your written work as notes,
- Or record a short video if your teacher allows.

**Marked On (10):**

- Clear, logical explanation.
- Uses correct math language (function, vertex, root, intercept, etc.).
- Stays within time and on topic.
