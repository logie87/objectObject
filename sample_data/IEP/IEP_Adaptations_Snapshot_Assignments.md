This document outlines practical adaptation options for the snapshot assignments we designed:

- Grade 6 ELA – Story & Character Snapshot  
- Grade 6 Math – Number Sense & Problem Solving Snapshot  
- Grade 6 Science – Egg Drop Engineering Snapshot  
- Grade 11 ELA – Literary Voices Snapshot

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES (ALL SUBJECTS)

- Maintain the **same core learning goal** as the class, adjust **how much**, **how**, or **how it’s shown**.
- Prefer:
  - shorter, clearer tasks over “more of the same”
  - chunked deadlines
  - modeled examples and templates
  - multi-modal options: oral / visual / typed / scribed
- Reduce writing volume before reducing thinking level.

  - fraction strips,
  - grids for decimals/percents.
- Model one example of each type, then do one together, then one independently.

**Output Options**
- Fewer questions of each type (e.g., 1–2 solid reps instead of a page).
- Allow:
  - drawing models,
  - using colour coding,
  - using manipulatives while solving.

**Assessment Focus**
- Prioritize:
  - Can they place, compare, and operate with numbers reasonably?
  - Do they know *why* they’re adding/multiplying/etc.?
- De-emphasize:
  - speed and large-volume drills.

**Extras**
- Let students find **real-life examples** of numbers, fractions, and percents (sales, sports stats, recipes).

### For Functions & Quadratics Snapshot (Pre-Calculus 11)

**Input Supports**
- Provide:
  - formula sheet,
  - labeled example graphs,
  - step-by-step sample solutions.

**Process Supports**
- Let student:
  - highlight given info,
  - work on **fewer but deeper** questions,
  - use calculator for arithmetic so focus stays on concepts.
- Encourage:
  - sketching graphs,
  - using tables,
  - colour-coding intercepts, vertex, etc.
- Allow drawing out relationships:
  - mapping diagram for functions,
  - arrows from equation → feature on graph.

**Output Options**
- Accept:
  - structured templates (“Step 1: ___; Step 2: ___”),
  - partial solutions with oral explanation.
- Keep:
  - one solid application problem instead of multiple.

**Assessment Focus**
- Check:
  - Do they know what f(x) means?
  - Can they identify key features from an equation or graph?
  - Can they describe what their quadratic solution means in words?
- Reduce:
  - heavy algebraic manipulation if that is not the IEP focus.

**Extras**
- Let student bring **real examples of functions**:
  - growth/decay graphs,
  - height-time graphs from sports,
  - simple data they collect and model.

## SCIENCE (Gr. 6 & 11)
