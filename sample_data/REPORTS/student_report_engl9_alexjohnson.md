---

## Quick Teacher View

**Key idea:** Alex can do the thinking. Barriers are decoding, reading stamina, and tracking. Use text-to-speech, chunked reading, and alternative response formats so he can show grade-level understanding of the story and theme.

---

## Instructional Accommodations (Assignment-Specific)

- **Access to Text**
  - Provide **audio / text-to-speech** version of the story.
  - Offer a **clean, larger-font, double-spaced** copy; avoid cluttered pages.

- **Before Reading**
  - **Pre-teach 6–8 key words** with simple definitions + icons.
  - Give a **one-paragraph story preview** (setting, main characters, basic situation).

- **During Reading**
  - Chunk text into **short sections** (e.g., labeled Parts 1–4).
  - After each chunk, ask **2–3 guided questions** orally:
    - “What just happened?” / “What do we know about this character now?”
  - Allow use of **highlighter** (or digital highlight) for:
    - character traits,
    - clues to theme,
    - key events.

- **After Reading**
  - Use a **simple organizer**:
    - Box 1: “Who is the main character?”  
    - Box 2: “What problem do they have?”  
    - Box 3: “How is it solved?”  
    - Box 4: “What is the message (theme)?”
  - Let Alex discuss answers orally first, then record in brief written or typed form.

## Environmental Accommodations

- Preferential seating **away from high-traffic/noisy spots**.
- Option to read / listen in a **quiet corner or support room** for longer tasks.
- Quick **check-in at start and halfway**:
  - confirm he knows which section he’s on & what to do next.

---

## Assessment Accommodations

- **What You Mark**
  - Focus on:
    - understanding of **plot**, **character**, **theme**;
    - ability to support ideas with at least one detail.
  - Do **not** penalize for spelling, slow reading, or sentence-level errors.

- **Format Options**
  - Accept:
    - **Bullet points** instead of full paragraphs.
    - **Oral response** (teacher/EA scribes key points).
    - Short **voice recording** or typed response using assistive tech.
  - Provide **1.5x time** if done in-class (consistent with IEP). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

- **Chunked Task**
  - Part A: Identify key elements (who/where/what problem).  
  - Part B: Choose/theme from options OR write 1–2 simple sentences.  
  - Part C (optional): One supporting quote/scene (teacher can help locate).

## Technology Accommodations

- **Required/Recommended**
  - **Text-to-speech** for the story.
  - **Laptop** for responses with:
    - spell-check,
    - word prediction (if available).
  - **Speech-to-text** for longer responses when needed. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

---

## Behaviour & Routine Supports

- Clear, repeatable sequence on his handout:
  1. Listen/read Part 1  
  2. Answer 1–2 quick questions  
  3. Repeat for next part  
  4. Fill in organizer  
- Use **subtle prompt** if off-task:
  - point to next step or checklist rather than long verbal redirection.
- Acknowledge when he:
  - starts within a few minutes,
  - stays on task for chunk,
  - uses his tools independently.

---

## Communication & Social Supports

- Encourage Alex to:
  - Ask: “Can I hear that part again?” / “Can you clarify this question?”
  - Share his interpretation verbally in **small group or pair**.
- Adults:
  - Keep instructions **short, concrete, and step-based**.
  - Normalize his use of tech and bullets so it doesn’t feel like a penalty.
