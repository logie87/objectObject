- **Grade:** 8  
- **Designation:** Mild Intellectual Disability  
- **School:** Cedar Ridge Middle School  
- **Teacher:** Ms. Fraser  

- **Class:** Grade 8 Mathematics  
- **Unit:** Algebra & Functions  
- **Assignment:** Worksheet1  
- **Focus:** One-step equations, simple two-step equations, and basic function ideas using familiar real-world word problems.

---

## Instructional Accommodations (Assignment-Specific)

- **Level**
  - Use whole numbers **0–50** (extend toward 100 only as successful).
  - Prioritize **one-step equations**; introduce simple two-step only with support.

- **How to Teach**
  - Model **2–3 examples** with manipulatives and think-aloud.
  - Provide **guided practice** in small group or 1:1.
  - Move to **independent work** on a reduced, similar set of questions.

- **Content Design**
  - Use **familiar contexts**:
    - Money up to $20  
    - Days of the week  
    - Classroom tasks, simple games, interests
  - Use **visual equation frames** (e.g. `Start → Change → Result`, or `□ + 6 = 10`).
  - Keep **layout consistent** across items and pages.

- **Language**
  - Use **short, concrete directions**:
    - “Solve for the missing number.”
    - “How many more does he need?”
  - Pre-teach and display small word bank:
    - **more**, **less**, **total**, **left**.

---

## Environmental Accommodations

- **Seating**
  - Seat near **teacher/EA**, facing instruction, reduced distractions.

- **Grouping**
  - Use **small-group or 1:1** for instruction and initial item completion.

- **Time**
  - Allow **extended time**; permit completion over more than one session.

- **Breaks**
  - Provide brief **movement/sensory breaks** if focus or regulation declines.

---

## Assessment Accommodations

- **Reduced Load**
  - Select **8–12 key questions**:
    - Identifying the unknown
    - Matching story to equation
    - Solving one-step equations
  - Remaining items = **practice only**, not required for evidence.

- **Simplified Language**
  - Use **literal**, uncluttered wording with only relevant details.

- **Response Options**
  - Accept:
    - **Oral responses** to teacher/EA
    - **Pointing, circling, matching**
    - Adult scribing in equation frames if writing is a barrier

- **Success Criteria (For This Assignment)**
  - With visual and teacher support:
    - Matches a story to the correct equation in **4/5 attempts**.
    - Solves one-step equations to 20 with **≈80% accuracy** on selected items.
  - Aligned with IEP goal (operations within 100) at an accessible level.

- **Evidence Collection**
  - Quick checklist:
    - Identifies unknown? (Y/N)
    - Chooses operation with prompt? (Y/N)
    - Accuracy: __ / __
  - One brief note on effective supports (e.g., “number line helpful”).

---

## Technology Accommodations

- Use tablet for:
  - **Simple math apps** (missing number, number line, basic operations).
- Provide **mini visual schedule**, e.g.:
  1. Learn with teacher  
  2. Try 3 questions  
  3. Short break/app  
  4. Finish
- Allow Noah to **photograph examples/anchor charts** for reference.

---

## Behaviour & Routine Supports

- **Before**
  - Review short routine:
    - “Pencil → Read with adult → Use blocks/number line → Answer.”

- **During**
  - Use **one quiet prompt** as needed.
  - Reinforce **on-task behaviour and independence**.

- **After**
  - Quick reflection:
    - “Which felt easy?” / “What tool helped?”
  - Praise **effort and strategy**, not speed.

---

## Communication & Social Supports

- Prompt Noah to use simple, complete requests:
  - “Can you repeat that?”  
  - “I need help with this one.”
- Encourage sharing **one answer/strategy** in a small group (not required whole-class).
- All adults use **consistent, clear, concrete language**.
