# Expected Student Adaptation Report – Math 10

_In: Student Profile + IEP • Class • Unit • Assignment_

---

## Student & Context

- **Student:** Sofia Martinez  
- **PEN:** 741 852 963  
- **Grade:** 10  
- **Designation:** Learning Disability – Written Expression; ELL  
- **School:** Mountainview Secondary  
- **Teacher:** Mr. Singh  
- **IEP Summary:** Strong oral comprehension and ideas; difficulty with written organization, spelling, and editing under pressure. Benefits from visuals, sentence frames, exemplars, and assistive tech. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

- **Class:** Mathematics 10  
- **Unit:** Linear Relations & Functions  
- **Assignment:** Worksheet1 – Solving linear equations, interpreting linear relations (tables/graphs/equations), and applying to real-world contexts, aligned with BC Math 10 curricular competencies and content.

## Quick Teacher View

**Key idea:** She understands the math. Writing + language are the barrier. Strip down language load, scaffold written output, and let her show understanding through structured supports and tech.

## Instructional Accommodations (Assignment-Specific)

- **Language & Clarity**
  - Use **short, direct instructions**:
    - “Solve for x.” / “Match the equation to the graph.”
  - Bold/box **key words & numbers** in questions.
  - Pre-teach and display key terms:
    - _slope, intercept, rate of change, table, graph, increasing, decreasing_.

- **Worked Models & Structure**
  - Provide **1–2 worked examples** at top of each section:
    - clearly labeled steps (1. Identify info, 2. Substitute, 3. Solve, 4. Check).
  - Use **step-by-step scaffolds**:
    - “Step 1: Find slope” → “Step 2: Find y-intercept” → “Step 3: Write equation.”
  - Allow Sofia to **explain steps orally** before writing.

- **Task Design**
  - Keep core set focused on:
    - Solving linear equations.
    - Connecting tables, graphs, and equations.
    - Reading simple word problems tied to familiar situations (earnings, distance, phone plans).
  - Group questions by type (no constant switching):
    - Section A: Solve for x
    - Section B: Match forms (table/graph/equation)
    - Section C: Short word problems

---

## Environmental Accommodations

- Offer **quiet workspace** or low-distraction spot during the assignment.
- Provide **check-ins**:
  - At start: confirm she understands instructions.
  - Midway: clarify any confusing language and adjust if needed.

---

## Assessment Accommodations

- **Reduced Writing Load**
  - Allow:
    - Equations, numbers, and **short phrases** instead of full sentences.
    - **Pointing or circling** for “match” items.
    - Oral explanation with teacher/EA **scribing key steps**.

- **Extended Time & Chunking**
  - Break Worksheet1 into **small chunks** (e.g., 5–6 questions at a time).
  - Permit extra time without penalty.

- **Mark What Matters**
  - Assess **math thinking**, not spelling/grammar.
  - Provide **clear success criteria** at top in student-friendly language:
    - “I can solve linear equations.”
    - “I can match equations, tables, and graphs.”
    - “I can explain how I know (with support).”

---

## Technology Accommodations

- **Laptop/Chromebook**:
  - Use word processor with **spell-check and word prediction** for any written explanations.
  - Digital **graphic organizers** (e.g., input-output tables, step lists).
- **Translation support**:
  - Allowed for **key vocabulary** checks (not full-question translation) to support understanding.

---

## Communication & Routine

- Use consistent prompt sequence:
  - “Read → Highlight info → Identify what’s needed → Choose strategy → Solve → Check.”
- Encourage Sofia to:
  - Ask for clarification when wording is unclear (“Can you rephrase this?”).
  - Verbally walk through solutions; normalize this as an approved method.
- Staff:
  - Keep language **clear, concrete, and consistent** with her IEP tools.
